# RemindME
A responsive application, responsible for daily activites reminder.

**BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:**

      In the time we have today, we understand and appreciate how important it is to have enough 
    time to prepare for a meeting or convention that we may attend. In selected jobs such as secretaries 
    of an office or of an important person, it is imperative that the secretary has enough time to perform
    his duty to follow everything stated in his schedule chart. Still, with the changing times, it is also
    appropriate to have of changing the secretary in his or her usual or accustomed method of reminding or 
    providing information in each area it belongs to. so because of this, the project developers had the
    conclusion to help people in this situation to accept this change with emerging technology. And this
    is where the project developers thought of developing a web application that aims to help the referred 
    people to make their lives easier or accomplish their tasks.
    
      This web application works in such a way that it is appropriate for users to first put in this web 
    application the important tasks that he wants to be carried out at the time he chooses or at the appropriate
    time determined by the people themselves or the organization he serves. Within the application, there are 
    features that will give secretaries or designated people that they can freely use the application, they can add 
    tasks, they can also read the sequence of schedules contained in the web application, they can also edit each
    content of the schedules so that with the help of this it will be easier for users to understand and read the 
    content, and finally users can also delete the contents of the list of appointments that the application has if 
    he thinks that the events scheduled to take place are not continuing. every appointment that this web application 
    has included has a set time when it will be alarmed so that users know that the appointment they are waiting for
    is about to start.
       
       Project developers believe that fixing a simple task or problem with the help of our technology can help users
    to be more organized and productive in their daily work.
    
**DEVELOPMENT MODEL:**

   ![AGILE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102003365/181897075-12c5c4fd-3fa5-48e6-af05-170bcd0af3de.jpg)

        According to ATLASSIAN (2022), Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development
     that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything
     on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, 
     and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly. And 
     because of this study. The project developers have chosen to use this model so that they have the appropriate time and
     period to carefully study every detail and information that they will use to carry out the project that they are trying to do.
    
     PLANNING this is one of the most important phases of project development, because here the project developers discuss the 
     issues they have chosen to solve with the help of their desired project, also in this phase the studies on the tools or 
     frameworks to be used are indicated or seen for project development. Planning is important because if the conversation or 
     planning does not have a good result, the project may end up with an undesirable result.
      
    REQUIREMENTS AND ANALYSIS This phase deals with technical tasks. Especially for a developer. Because in this phase the project 
    developers must understand the things and aspects that they need to use and follow in the project itself, the project developers 
    also need to consider the importance that the application they are making will be widely used regardless of the platform, 
    because it is one of the ones that can provide points for each user.
   
    DESIGN This phase refers to the models used by the project developers to start the project, every decision or features that
    the application they made has plans and conditions that are followed. To further give the developers enough knowledge on
    how to process their needs.

    DEVELOP in this phase, the results of the two previous phases are discussed. This phase indicates the beginning of the production
    or process of the project with the help of the gathered information and framework that will be very helpful.

    TESTING in this phase, the developed project is tested, here it is checked if the project has followed the rules stated in the 
    previous phases. It is also checked here if the application is worthy of the deployment phase, and if the application does not 
    pass this phase, it will continue to return to the development phase to possibly meet the expectations demanded by the previous 
    phases.

    DEPLOY It is in this phase that an application is tested in beta/alpha tests, so that the developers can learn more if there is 
    still a need to develop the application. Because of this phase some select users will be able to use the project created by the
    developers. And if the opportunity comes to fix something here, the application will continue to work but will be done temporarily
    to add the updates that are wanted to know or required by its requirements.
